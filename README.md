# _superwell_: A physics-based hydro-economic model for groundwater cost and supply assessment

The [`superwell`](https://github.com/JGCRI/superwell.git) model provides estimates of the global extractable volumes and unit-costs $(USD/km^3)$ of accessible groundwater production under user-specified extraction scenarios.  
The structure of [`superwell`](https://github.com/JGCRI/superwell.git) is:

- input driven  
- fast, flexible and robust  
- spatially and temporally flexible (covers grid to global and hourly to centennial scales)

## Getting Started  

[`superwell`](https://github.com/JGCRI/superwell.git) can be installed directly from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/JGCRI/superwell.git) by simply cloning it. Run the following from command prompt or any terminal that supports `git` commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JGCRI/superwell.git
```

### Run superwell

Navigate to [`python/`](./python/) and run [superwell with deepening](./python/superwell_deepening.py) script to simulate using default settings and scenario assumptions. Installing `python` and key libraries is evidently a pre-requisite.

Adjust [params.csv](./inputs/params.csv) in [`inputs/`](./inputs/) folder to fit your scenario design needs. The script will automatically populate results in [`outputs/`](./outputs/) folder.  

### Conceptual Overview

![superwell conceptual overview](concept.png)

## Inputs

All inputs are in [`inputs/`](./inputs/) folder. The [`superwell`](https://github.com/JGCRI/superwell.git) code requires two primary input files:

- [params.csv](./inputs/params.csv) defining model settings and scenario assumptions  
- [inputs.csv](./inputs/inputs.csv) containing grided aquifer thickness, porosity, depth to water, permeability, grid area, WHY class, and grid area

and two supporting data files:

- [GCAM_Electricity_Rates.csv](./inputs/GCAM_Electricity_Rates.csv) providing  assumptions on the cost of electricity in 172 countries
- [Theis_well_function_table.csv](./inputs/Theis_well_function_table.csv) as a look-up table for relation between $u$ and well function $W(u)$  

[`inputs/`](./inputs/) folder also contains digitized, geo-processed [shape files](./inputs/shapefiles/) of aquifer properties that makes the contents of the [inputs.csv](./inputs/inputs.csv) file after processing.

[![DOI](https://data.msdlive.org/badge/DOI/10.57931/2307831.svg)](https://doi.org/10.57931/2307831)

See [documentation on inputs](./inputs/README.md) for more details.  

## Outputs  

All outputs are written to [`outputs/`](./outputs/) folder as `.csv` formats.
A select-few key outputs include: extractable volumes, drawdown, number of wells, costs including capital, maintenance, pumping, and unit costs of groundwater production.
